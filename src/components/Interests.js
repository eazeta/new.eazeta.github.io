			<h3>Music Production</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a self taught music producer and I go by Project Emanzyy! I have been producing and
				releasing beats since 2020. I taught myself piano to a basic level to aid in my music
				production and I am currently learning the guitar. I mainly foucs on hip-hop beats as shown
				below but I have dabbled in other genres such as lofi and hyperpop (which you can listen to
				on my soundcloud)
			</p>
			<h3>Gym</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a firm believer in good body = good mind so I go to the gym 4 times a week. I'm
				currently training using a Push-Pull-Legs split but I also compound these exercises with
				calisthenics and mobility work on my functional training day
